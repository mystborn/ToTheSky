# To the Sky

To the Sky is an RPG under development. It's written exclusively in C. While you can build the code yourself if you're truly determined, none of the assets exist in this repo. As such, it mostly exists as reference material and a fallback if my personal computer ever fails. If you'd like to assist in the development process, you can always reach me on discord at mystborn#0264.
